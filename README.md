# Gold Recovery Efficiency Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model for Zyfra to predict gold recovery from ore processing. 
The goal is to optimize production efficiency by predicting:
- Rougher flotation recovery
- Final concentrate recovery

## Process Description

1. **Flotation**
   - Initial concentration of gold from ore mixture
   - Produces rougher Au concentrate and tails

2. **Purification**
   - Two-stage cleaning process
   - Produces final concentrate

## Project Tasks
1. Data Preparation and Analysis
2. Model Development
3. Performance Evaluation
